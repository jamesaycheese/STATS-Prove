    "Now, let's explain how this Monte Carlo simulation works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Setup: We are trying to estimate the value of π (pi) using a Monte Carlo method. The idea behind this method is to use random sampling to compute numerical results. In this case, we'll use random points in a square to estimate the value of π.\n",
    "Simulation: We generate a large number of random points within a square with side length 2 (ranging from -1 to 1 on both the x and y axes). Each point is represented by its coordinates (x, y).\n",
    "Estimation of π: We consider the unit circle inscribed within the square. Points that fall inside the unit circle (i.e., satisfy the condition x² + y² ≤ 1) are counted as inside points, while those outside are counted as outside points.\n",
    "Ratio Calculation: We then calculate the ratio of points inside the circle to the total number of points generated. Since the area of the unit circle is πr² and the area of the square is (2r)² = 4r² (where r = 1), the ratio of the areas is π/4. So, we multiply the ratio of points inside the circle by 4 to estimate the value of π.\n",
    "Output: Finally, we print out the estimated value of π based on the number of samples used in the simulation.\n",
    "As we increase the number of samples (randomly generated points), the estimation of π becomes more accurate due to the law of large numbers, which states that the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value."
